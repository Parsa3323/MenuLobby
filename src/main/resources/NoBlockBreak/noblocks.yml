# as the plugin "NoBlocks" wasn't that good to not cancel in-game block-break events i made a built-in
# no blocks plugin heres the config:

NoBlocks:
  # enable or disable no blocks feature if you have another plugins for it
  enabled: true
  # enabling is recommended because if you disable it, it blocks every block break in your server no matter in-game or not
  only-spawn-world: true
  # the message that when someone breaks blocks but doesn't have permission will get (You can use colors)
  no-perm: "§cYou can't break blocks Sorry"
NoAnvils:
  # enable or disable no blocks feature if you have another plugins for it
  enabled: false
  no-perms: "§cSorry anvils are disabled on this server"
NoChests:
  # this includes ender chests
  enabled: true
  # same as the NoBlocks
  only-spawn-world: true
  # no perm msg
  no-perm: "§cSorry chests/ender chests are disabled in this server"
